## Code structure

The folder *OpenSourceCode* is the source code of the paper, where the folder *jupytercode* is the main logic code of the paper, and other folders are relevant python packages, which are called by the ipynb code file. Readers can learn about code using methods by reading files of ipynb in the folder *jupytercode*.

## Notes

The following points need to be clarified.

1. The extraction of road network structure characteristic variables and built environment variables in the paper is realized by the second author of the paper, and this part of code is not included in this repository.
2. The folder *data* is only used as an example of folder structure and does not store data inside.
